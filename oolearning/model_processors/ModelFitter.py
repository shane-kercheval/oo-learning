    ModelFitter encapsulates the (mundane and repetitive) logic of the general process of "training" an
        unsupervised model i.e. we aren't "training" a model against a target variable (that is, no `data_y`
        in `train()`.

        including:

        - data transformations & pre-processing
        - training i.e. fitting a model

    Very similar to ModelTrainer, except it does not have various unused functionality (e.g. splitting data)
